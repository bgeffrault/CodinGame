Files are Javascript solutions for mars lander missions.
Mars lander solution 2 works for mission 1 & 2 and it's a hardcoding way to solve the puzzle.
Mars lander GA simulator (index.html & code.js) has to be used with a navigator by opening the index file. Then use the debug consol to see the working process and the results.

The limits of the GA simulator are :
- Takes to much time to be validated has a solution by the CodinGame plateforme
- The selection part (roulette wheel) is not well implemented and need to be improved in order to recreate a real roulette wheel method.
